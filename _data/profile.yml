First is that <strong>Unity UI doesn't feel native, and also doesn't perform like native</strong> which makes sense. I've ran into issues where as I continue to use the app my phone just heats up really bad, and the experience is just laggy as I scroll through many videos. That's when I decided to use another framework instead and that was <strong>Flutter; which I learned from scratch</strong> just to create this project.",
      "<strong>Learning Flutter meant I need to learn Dart</strong>, the language it uses for scripting. As I build the app in Flutter, all the issues I've encountered in Unity were solved resulting into the app that you're seeing on the video.",
      "It's also worth to know that <strong>this app is connected to a backend</strong>, I've <strong>built a backend with MongoDB as its database (to store video and VTuber metadata), and Bunny as it's CDN for some images and dynamic data in the app</strong>. I've then deployed this backend to a VPS that I own.",
      "Aside from the backend, I've also <strong>created a scraper which scrapes VTuber data</strong> (video metadata: live videos, scheduled videos, archives, etc., creator metadata: VTuber profile picture, social media numbers like YouTube views count) from various sources. This scraper runs on my VPS 24/7 gathering and pushing data to my backend server.",
      "This app is actually <strong>still live right now and still connected to my backend server</strong>, and you can use it by installing the APK for it on your Android device for your own testing. The only problem is that I stopped the scraper, but I can bring it back again if I want to."
